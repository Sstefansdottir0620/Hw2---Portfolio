                <p>My name is Stefania Stefansdottir and I want to welcome you to my humble portfolio. I was born and raisewd in Iceland, Reykjavik and the reason I ended up
                    in Dallas is a long story that I can tell you once we know each other better. 
                    I have held many jobs in my short life-span. I've waited on tables, been a chef, worked the gas station, been a clerk at the supermarket,
                    worked at MC Donalds, been a sports-camp supervisor for children, been a youth tennis trainer, worked the front desk at Saga Hotel, Reykjavik and been a flight-attendant at IcelandAir.
                    I've also worked as a graphic designer both freelance and full-time in-office. I've done website develpoment for non-profit organizations and worked in the Commercial Real Estate 
                    field as an office manager and property manager. I probably left something out,..oh yes,..i worked one summer in a bakery in Oslo, Norway. It was Norways
                    rainiest summer in 50 years! I also paint when I have the time to spare.
                    I am a mother of two incredible boys who love soccer, music and art and that also keeps me on my toes as you can imagine. Having said all this I've probably given too mush information.
                    My goal is to become successful in the WebDevelopment world as a Full Stack Web Developer. To reach my goal I've completed the Coding Bootcamp at SMU and will contoinue to learn through
                    numerous resources introduced during the last 4 months.
